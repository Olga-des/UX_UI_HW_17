            Hi there, my name is Olga Peshkova. I'm based in Melbourne and specialise in user research, responsive web, desktop and mobile design. 
            Over the past 10 years I've drawn from my graphic design background to complete a wide range of projects in branding, illustration, photography, digital and print media. With this experience I've taken the next step into the world of UX/UI where I can put my efforts into improving and designing digital products that are beautiful, simple and efficient.
            Outside of work I enjoy reading, working on personal creative projects, learning and messing around in the garden with my beautiful labrador, Sam.
